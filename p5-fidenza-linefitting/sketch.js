/*

Mainly, the thing that I care about here is the line-fitting: Two lines should
never cross or overlap. You could perhaps generate a bunch of random lines and
see if they overlap. But that takes O(n^2) time, where n is the number of the
points in the lines, and that sucks. Instead, I'm going to create a rectangular
grid of spaces at low resolution (say, 10x10), and then I'll pick contiguous
stretches of boxes. I'll either subdivide those boxes, or I'll "claim" them for
a line. Once a box has been claimed, it cannot be claimed by any other line.

Finally, I'll draw the grid â€” but with one important caveat: I will distort all
the points according to global Perlin noise. This will add some ZEST
